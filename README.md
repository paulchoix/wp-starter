# Starter Theme

Just another Wordpress theme using namespaces.

## Installation

After installation, use the search and replace function (case sensitive) to change the following:

- starter-theme -> your theme's text domain (hyphens only)
- starter_theme -> your theme's name in lowercase with underscores and hyphens
- Starter Theme -> your theme's name
- Starter_Theme -> your theme's namespace

You will also find starter examples in the <code>settings.php</code> file. Delete or replace them as needed.

The Roboto font family is included as an example font: there are no references to this font family, so it can be deleted.

## OG Images

In the <code>assets/img</code> folder, you'll find images corresponding to the <b>maximum size</b> accepted by top social media platforms before compression. Facebook's 1200x627 format is the standard Open Graph format with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Instagram compresses everything above 1080x1080. Twitter will accept images as large as 4096x4096.
